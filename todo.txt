TODO:
- Clean up Nondle and host at nondle.ckbarrett.com

Maybe:
- Consider adding Theta Tau to about? 
- Possible bug: page not found on linkedin link
    - Apparently it breaks if not logged in. Not sure how to fix this.

DONE:
- Take away contact section so it's not confusing, put buttons somewhere else but okay to duplicate with footer
- Make the pictures links in project section
- Shrink text/clean up picture in about section (from Tess)
- Change resume button (from Tess)
- Consider embedding resume into website - or link out to subpage with embedded resume
- More visual effects - eye candy! 
- Fork Jimmy and host at snake.ckbarrett.com
- Fix content width for about section on mobile
